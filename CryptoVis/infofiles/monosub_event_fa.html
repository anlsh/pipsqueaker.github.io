    <p>After hundreds, if not thousands, of years of security, a way to crack the monosubstitution cipher was proposed
    by the Arabian mathematician Al-Kindi*. This method, known today as Frequency Analysis, uses the fact that, given
    a sufficiently large sample of text, certain letters will appear with relatively constant frequencies.</p>
    <img class="info_img" src="infofiles/res/frequencyAnalysis.jpg">
    <p>For instance, about 12% of all the characters in a given passage of English will be the letter e. Through
    analyzing how often a character appears in the enciphered text, and through some educated guessing, it is
    possible to decrypt intercepted messages</p>
    <p style="font-size:12px">* Fun fact, Al-Kindi's full name was Abu Yūsuf Yaʻqūb ibn ʼIsḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ al-Kindī</p>
