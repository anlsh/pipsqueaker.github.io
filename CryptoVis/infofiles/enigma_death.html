    <p>Cracking the Enigma required almost superhuman ingenuity and perseverance, along with the development of some
    of the first robots- a much more involved and comprehensive explanation of the process can be found

     <p>It should be noted, however, that the Enigma was, even with modern technology, essentially impossible to crack.
     However, German machine certain crucial repetitions, such as broadcasting a weather report each morning. During
         the 1930's, Marian Rejweski, through a combination of espionage and genius, identified the presence of these
         repetitions in intercepted messages, allowing Alan Turing to crack the Enigma during WWII.</p>
