            Number of ways a message can be enciphered: 26
        </p>
        <p>Ease of encryption: High</p>
        <p>Security: Low</p>

    <p>The Caesar Cipher is simple- each letter of a message is mapped to the letter a given number of entries behind
    it in the alphabet. For instance, the message "Veni vidi vici" enciphered with a shift of two would be
        "Xgpk xkfk xkek". To decipher a message, one could simply unshift the letters to obtain the original message.
