            Number of ways a message can be enciphered: 26

    <p>Null ciphers are, in fact, a large and diverse group of ciphers. What gives these ciphers their name is the
    fact that a piece of enciphered text cotains junk, or "null," data.
    </p><p>One example of a null-enciphered message is
    "dtdlHjkbrdjklrsjklbdrtdhfdrtdjkEbtrljdubjkdrt", which is the phrase "GarbageData" enciphered with a
    monosubstitution cipher and using d, t, r, j, k, and l as null characters.</p>
    <p>Another example would be the ciphertext <div class="mini_code">Charlie weeded alpine apples smelling terrible
</div> Taking the second letter of each word yields the message "helpme"</p>
    <p>The presence of these nulls makes messages,ore difficult to decrypt and, with well-chosen nulls, can even make
        text enciphered withmonosubstitution-null cipher impervious to frequency analysis. Unfortunately, null ciphers
        do have a drawback in that they inflate message size which, especially in the modern era of data caps and
    bandwidth limits, make them unappealing to use.</p>
