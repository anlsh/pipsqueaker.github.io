    <p>Due to the numerous similarities which the Lorenz Machines shared with Enigma, British codebreakers were able
    to use a similar approach to break it. Given that the Lorenz Machines were much more secure, however, devices more
    advanced than Turing's automechanical bombes were required to break the code. Colossus, one of the world's first
    programmable computers, was constructed to aid in this effort, and helped usher in the era of modern computing</p>
