    <p class="info_heading">The Kasiki-Babbage Test</p>
    <p>After nearly three centuries of total security, Charles Babbage and Freidrich Kasiki cracked the cipher
    independently during the mid-1800's. The attack hinges upon being able to find repeated strings within the
    characters. For instance, take the following ciphertext</p>
    <div class="mini_code">
        <strong>FGX</strong>WENFJFRDSG<strong>FGX</strong>JFGXWEJLJK<strong>FGX</strong>JJKWEJNKJG
    </div>
    <p>The savvy codebreaker will notice that the sequence FGX, which might correspond to a common three-letter sequence
        in English such as "the", is repeated every thirteenth letter. Such a repetition strongly indicates that a
    thirteen-letter key is being used. After this, all that remains is to break the original ciphertext into thirteen
    subgroups, with the first subgroup consisting of the first letter of each thirteen-letter block (WJJ), the second consisting of the
    second letters (EFJ), and so on.</p>
    <p>These subgroups of letters have effectively been enciphered with monosubstitution ciphers, and thus by applying
    frequency analysis we can decipher the subgroups and therefore the Vigenere Cipher</p>
    <p>Note: While the method described above works in principle, the ciphertext given is simply too small to be
    deciphered. For a more complete look at how to crack the Vigenere Cipher, check out
