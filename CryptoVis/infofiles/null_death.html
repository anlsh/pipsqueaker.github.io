    <p class="info_heading">Death of the Null Cipher?</p>
    <p>The Null Cipher had a few problems, such as bloating the size of messages, but was relatively secure- in fact,
    there is still research going on today as to how to detect and break null ciphers. The Null Cipher was left
    behind, with the Vignere Cipher promising quicker encryption.</p>
    <p>The Null Cipher has had a resurgence of sorts in modern times, with the field of Noise Encryption drawing
    heavily on its principles.</p>
