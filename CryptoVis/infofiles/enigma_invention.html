    <p>Arther Scherbius invented the Enigma machine in 1918, during the twilight of the First World War. Almost
        terrifyingly advanced for the time, the Enigma was adopted just a few years later by the German Army and
    Navy, and would go on to serve as their key form of communication during WWII.</p>
