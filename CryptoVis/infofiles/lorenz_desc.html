        <p>Number of ways a message can be enciphered: 10^15</p>
        <p>Ease of encryption: High</p>
        <p>Security: High</p>

    <p>The Lorenz SZ40 was a machine both similar to and hugely more secure than the Enigma. Whereas the Enigma used a
    mere 5 rollers, Lorenz machines used at least 12. Furthermore, rather than basing its encryption on the standard
    26-letter alphabet, Lorenz machines used the Baudot Alphabet.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The Lorenz machines worked by adding an obscuring letter to each letter of the plaintext. Crucially, the Baudot
    Alphabet has the property that, if a letter δ is obscured by adding λ via modulo-2 addition to obtain φ,
    then adding φ to λ will yield δ.</p>
    <p>The plain-english way to explain the above is that a Lorenz-enciphered message can be deciphered by
    adding to the ciphertext the exact same sequence of characters used to encipher it.</p>
