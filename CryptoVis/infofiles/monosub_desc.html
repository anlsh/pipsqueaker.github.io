    <p>The Monosubstitution Cipher works in almost the same way as the Caesar Cipher except, rather than the cipher
    alphabet simply being shifted, the letters of the cipher alphabet are randomly mapped. However in practice,
        remembering a
    random ordering of letters proved difficult and inconvenient.</p>
    <p>To solve this issue, those communicating with a monosubstitution cipher would establish a keyword ahead of time,
        such as "monosubstitution", and use it to create a cipher alphabet by removing duplicate letters and then
    appending the rest of the alphabet. Thus, the cipher alphabet resulting from "monosubstitution" would be</p>
    <div class="mini_code">monsubitonacdefghjklpqrvwxyz</div>
    <p>... with "a"s in plaintext ciphering to "m"s, "b"s to "o"s, and so on.</p>
