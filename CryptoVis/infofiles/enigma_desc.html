        Enigma Machines were essentially a mechanized Vigenere Cipher. However, Enigma Machines had multiple features
        which made them much more secure than a simple Vigenere Cipher. First, the Enigma machines included five
        rotors which could be reordered at will. Second, the Enigma included a mechanism which semi-randomly rotated
        a roller, changing the Vigenere key being used in the middle of the message. Finally, the machine also includes
        a plugboard which can modified to further obfuscate the message.</p>

        rollers and plugboard.</div></p>
    <p>The above features combine to form a machine which is essentially impossible to decrypt, which makes the
        achievements of the British and Polish codebreakers nothing short of astounding
