            Number of ways a message can be enciphered: Infinite
        </p>
        <p>Ease of encryption: Low, almost to the point of unfeasability</p>
        <p>Security: High</p>

    <p>Nomenclators worked on the same basic principle as monosubstitution ciphers. However, rather than acting upon
        letters, nomenclators act on words and even phrases. For instance, the message "Attack at dawn" could be
    enciphered as "λ ζ ψ".</p>
    <p>As might be expected, keys for nomenclators were nearly impossible to memorize, and thus nomenclators often
    necessitated the use of physical dictionaries which were at risk of being captured by the enemy.</p>
