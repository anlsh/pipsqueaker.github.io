    <div class="mini_code">
        <p>Number of ways a message can be enciphered: 26! * 26, or 10^28</p>
        <p>Ease of encryption: High</p>
        <p>Security: Low</p>
    </div>
    <p>The Vigenere Cipher works essentially through combining several Caesar ciphers. Similarly to the the
        monosubstitution cipher, those using the Vigenere Cipher to communicate first choose a keyphrase, such as
    "TIMERULES" Then, the first letter of the message of the message is encrypted using the Caesar-shifted alphabet
    starting with "T", the the second letter encrypted with the alphabet starting with "I", and so on. Once all letters
    of the keyphrase have been used up, the user restarts at the beginning of the keyword.</p>

    <p>Using the Vignere Cipher and the keyword "TIMERULES", the message "This is a super secret message" encrypts to
    "mpuw zm l wmimd wvwcil fmewrap"</p>
    <p>The Vigenere Cipher offers two major advantages over a traditional monosubstitution cipher. One is that the same
    letter in the plaintext may encipher to different letters. For instance, the "i" in "This" enciphers to "p",
    but the "i" in "is" enciphers to "z". The Vigenere's Cipher's second advantage is that the same letter in the
        ciphertext may, depending on its position,
    represent different letters in the plaintext. The combination of these two traits makes the Vignere Cipher
    completely impervious to traditional frequency analysis.</p>
