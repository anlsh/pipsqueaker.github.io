            <p><h3>About Me</h3></p>
            <p>My name is Anish Moorthy (which you probably know by now), and I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate in Georgia Tech's Computer Science program.</p><p>Computer Science has been an interest of mine for the past four years of my life- I originally got into it because I wanted to create Minecraft mods, and I never really escaped. I enjoy the theoretical side of Computer Science, along working on unsolved problems: my current interests are natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and language processing.</p><p>I've played around with quite a few programming language, but the ones which I'm best at (and love working in) are C++ and Python.</p><p>Here at Georgia Tech, I'm currently involved in the RoboCup section of the RoboJackets and the Linux Users Group.</p><p> </p>
