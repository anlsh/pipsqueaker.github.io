	      Hi! My name is Anish Moorthy. I'm a CS major at Georgia Tech, set to (hopefully) graduate in 2020. Coding has been a hobby of mine for over four years now. Things I like things such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, games, and a whole bunch of other stuff. My dislikes are as follows: coding websites.

	Have fun looking around!
